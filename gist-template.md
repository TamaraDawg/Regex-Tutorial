# Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial on regular expressions (regex). In this tutorial, we will explore the various components of regex and provide detailed explanations of each component's purpose and functionality. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience with regex, this tutorial will help you understand and master the art of pattern matching and text manipulation.
## Summary
In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific regex pattern that aims to match and extract email addresses from a given text. The regex pattern we will be discussing is:

`\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b`

This pattern is designed to match valid email addresses by considering the general structure and rules associated with them. We will break down this regex pattern and explain the purpose and function of each component.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are regex components used to match specific positions within the text. In our email address regex, we utilize the word boundary anchor `\b` to ensure that the pattern matches the complete email address and does not include partial matches.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers allow us to specify the number of occurrences or range of occurrences of a specific character or group. We use the `+` quantifier in our regex pattern to indicate that the preceding character or group should occur one or more times. For example, `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+` ensures that the local part of the email address contains one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs, or hyphens.
### OR Operator
 
 The OR operator (`|`) allows us to specify multiple alternatives in a regex pattern. However, in our email address regex, we do not utilize the OR operator.
### Character Classes

Character classes provide a way to match any character from a specific set. In our pattern, we use character classes such as [A-Za-z0-9] to match any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit. We also use the character class [.-] to match a dot or hyphen.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of a regex pattern. In our tutorial, we won't be discussing flags extensively, as they are not required for our email address regex.
### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing allow us to define subpatterns within a regex and capture their matched values. In our email address regex, we do not explicitly use grouping or capturing.
### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character sets, are used to match a single character from a specified set or range. We utilize bracket expressions in our regex pattern to match the domain part of the email address. For example, `[A-Za-z0-9.-]` matches any uppercase or lowercase letter, digit, dot, or hyphen.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy and lazy matching control the behavior of quantifiers. In our email address regex, we use greedy matching by default. This means that quantifiers will match as much as possible while still allowing the regex pattern to succeed.
### Boundaries
Boundaries are used to match specific positions in the text, such as the start or end of a word. We utilize the word boundary anchor `\b` in our email address regex to ensure that the pattern matches complete email addresses and does not include partial matches.
### Back-references
Back-references allow us to refer back to previously matched subpatterns. In our email address regex, we do not utilize back-references.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are used to ensure that a specific pattern is followed or preceded by another pattern without including it in the match. In our email address regex, we do not utilize look-ahead or look-behind assertions.
