# Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial on regular expressions (regex). In this tutorial, we will explore the various components of regex and provide detailed explanations of each component's purpose and functionality. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience with regex, this tutorial will help you understand and master the art of pattern matching and text manipulation.
## Summary
In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific regex pattern that aims to match and extract email addresses from a given text. The regex pattern we will be discussing is:

\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b

This pattern is designed to match valid email addresses by considering the general structure and rules associated with them. We will break down this regex pattern and explain the purpose and function of each component.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are regex components used to match specific positions within the text. In our email address regex, we utilize the word boundary anchor `\b` to ensure that the pattern matches the complete email address and does not include partial matches.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers allow us to specify the number of occurrences or range of occurrences of a specific character or group. We use the `+` quantifier in our regex pattern to indicate that the preceding character or group should occur one or more times. For example, `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+` ensures that the local part of the email address contains one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs, or hyphens.
### OR Operator
 
 The OR operator (`|`) allows us to specify multiple alternatives in a regex pattern. However, in our email address regex, we do not utilize the OR operator.
