# Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial on regular expressions (regex). In this tutorial, we will explore the various components of regex and provide detailed explanations of each component's purpose and functionality. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience with regex, this tutorial will help you understand and master the art of pattern matching and text manipulation.
## Summary
In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific regex pattern that aims to match and extract email addresses from a given text. The regex pattern we will be discussing is:

\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b

This pattern is designed to match valid email addresses by considering the general structure and rules associated with them. We will break down this regex pattern and explain the purpose and function of each component.
